# Ignition Image Viewer

This is an image viewer for the 1997 game "Ignition" (known as "Bleifuss Fun" in german speaking countries and "Fun Tracks" in France).

Try it here: https://vlaube-de.github.io/ignition-image-viewer/

Supported file types:
* .tex - load a .col palette before
* .pic
* .lft - these are in the "fonts" directory. the file "ignition.lft" does not work, it seems to be in another format.
